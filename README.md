These scripts will prompt for a dot-notated mac address, convert it into hexdecimal
Then will prompt for selection of four servers to select from
create a file to execute from a template
connect to server and pull the DHCP leases to the mac address you entered.

You will need to replace in <usernames>, <ip addresses>and maybe commands they may differ per your network.

Software requirements:
apps needed are bash and expect

put all files in a directory, open terminal in the directory 
and execute the file by typing ./get-dhcp

Have fun networking
